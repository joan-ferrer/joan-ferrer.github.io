Hi! I am Joan, a PhD student at the Univeristy of Copenhagen. I work in the Algebra and Gemoetry section, under the supervision of [Elisenda Feliu](https://web.math.ku.dk/~efeliu/) and [Máté L. Telek](https://matetelek.wordpress.com/). My research interests revolve around real algebraic geometry and its applications in reaction networks theory and optimization.
